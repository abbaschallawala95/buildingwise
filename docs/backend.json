    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to enable secure and efficient CRUD operations for the BuildingWise application, focusing on authorization independence and clear access control.  The structure follows a hierarchical approach with Buildings at the top level, and Members, Transactions, and Expenses as subcollections.  This structure aligns with the principle of Path-Based Ownership where each entity is owned by the Building to which it belongs. All subcollections include the `buildingId` as a denormalized field.  This denormalization is CRITICAL for Authorization Independence, as it avoids `get()` calls in security rules to verify building ownership.  The structure supports the required QAPs by segregating data per building, which simplifies list operations (rules are not filters)."
